# Workout Plan App

https://emily-foley.github.io/Workout-Plan-App/

This react native project is a workout plan app that includes four screens and three main components. 

The home screen displays buttons for each part of the workout routine. The first button leads to the warm ups page. Inside of this page, the Warmups component displays a flatlist of cards, each with a different image and text description for the warmup. 

The next three buttons on the home page are different repetition exercises for the user to complete that are displayed using a flatlist. These screens use the ExerciseScreen component to display the exercise names, descriptions, counter add and reset buttons, and suggested exercise buttons.

The last button is the cool down button which leads to a page with a countdown timer that gives the user 45 seconds to cool down. This screen uses the Cooldown component to display a countdown timer with start, pause, and reset buttons.
